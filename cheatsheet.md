This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

At the car: drive east, drive west, drive north
At the grocery store: enter grocery store, go north, go west, go east, go south, find eggs, find flour, find butter, find sugar, find chocolate, find peanut butter, find baking soda, find baking powder, find vanilla
At crumbl shop: go north, go east, go west, leave crumbl, enter crumbl, blend, bake cookie, decorate cookie, sell cookie, eat cookie,(if a player eats their baked cookie, it ruins their chances of selling their cookie and they have to go back to the grocery store to get ingredients again and reblend, or if they eat their cookie not baked, they die)
